## Hangman Game
The Hangman Game is a classic word game where the player's task is to guess the hidden word before the attempt limit is reached. This project was created as part of my learning process in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as to showcase my programming skills to potential employers.

## Technologies
The project was developed using the following technologies:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Features
Word Randomization: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of movies titles.
Interactive Interface: The user types letters using the keyboard.
Attempt Counter: The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
Graphical Representation of the Hangman: With each incorrect answer, the hangman drawing is gradually completed.
Victory/Loss Messages: After guessing the word or running out of attempts, an appropriate message is displayed.
